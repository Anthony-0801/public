# Public <sub>(Repository)</sub> - _JSON POST with Data Integration_ <sub>(API Name)</sub>
A PHP API for our subject System Integration and Architecture

## API Description
JSON POST API endpoint facilitates the transmission of structured data from clients to a server. This API allows for actions such as creating new records or updating existing ones. The data is transmitted in JSON format via HTTP POST requests, making it versatile and suitable for various purposes, including user registration and data updates. Authentication measures are in place to ensure secure access.

Once the server processes the data, it responds with an HTTP status code and a JSON response containing relevant information. Additionally, the API can integrate the received JSON data into a database system, involving tasks like validation, database connections, and queries.
